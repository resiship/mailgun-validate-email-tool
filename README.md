mailgun-validate-email
=================

Super tiny wrapper of email validation API from [Mailgun](http://www.mailgun.com/),
useful in form validation. This can be most useful in form validation to avoid those pesky spam emails. 

### Disclaimer
This module uses a third party service from Mailgun to verify the validity of the email,
you can read all the info in their [API docs](http://documentation.mailgun.com/api-email-validation.html)  
Emails are *securely transmitted* using Public Key Cryptography

## Usage

```sh
npm install mailgun-validate-email --save
```

```javascript
var validator = require('mailgun-validate-email')('INSERT-YOUR-MAILGUN-PUBKEY-HERE')
validator("banana@papaia.com", function (err, result){
  if(err) {
    // email was not valid
  } else {
    console.log(result);
    // register the person for your service etc.
  }
})
```

Output will be something like

```javascript
{
  is_valid: true,
  parts: {
    local_part: banana,
    domain: papaia.com,
    display_name: null
  },
  address: 'banana@papaia.com',
  did_you_mean: null
}
```


### *Why* use Third-Party Email Validation?

There are *easier* ways of checking if an email conforms to the correct *format*
e.g: using [**Joi**](https://github.com/hapijs/joi#example) `Joi.string().email()`  
But a validation library only checks that the address "*looks*" valid,
the Mailgun API actually checks if the domain has a valid [**DNS mx record**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record)
(checking if the domain *accepts* emails).

This means you don't waste time (or money) sending emails to **valid@foo.bar**  
(*valid* email address which will *fail* to deliver and thus
  clog up your inbox with failure reports!)

  **Note**: this will *not* prevent people from registering with your
  service/app using a *real* email they *don't control*.  
  e.g: **barack@whitehouse.gov** ...  
  so you should still get people to *confirm* their email address by sending them
  an email with a unique token.  
  (this will prevent people registering as someone else)
